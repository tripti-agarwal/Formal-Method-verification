Comments

Good analysis of the problems. In particular:

1. preorders and partial orders in Alloy
   Nicely illustrated steps

2. The store-buffer issue for TSO violations
   Nice explanations given

3. Java volatiles
   Would have been nice to see a summary result stating what happens when
   only one variable (req or ack) is made volatile

4. BFS and DFS pseudo-codes. 

   Good details! Very thoroughly documented and linked to PDF!
   
5. Double-checked locking
   Good observations about the double-checked locking
   in Java

Overall, thorough work for which I'm giving extra points!
