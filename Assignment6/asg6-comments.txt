The project description is good and I look forward to your steady progress. Why network flows
(just curious)? I'm sure it will be a really insightful example. Maybe we can try some
traditional loop-based iterative (computational) code, and perhaps also some memory (heap)
related codes, so that we gain experience with various plugins.
